Due to the large sizes of the pretrained and fine-tuned models (SPECTER2 and RoBERTa), we are unable to provide them in the repository. However, the code for training can be found in the corresponding notebooks. 

Specifically for the SPECTER2 and logistic regression pipeline, we are mixing objects from the `transformers` and `sklearn` libraries, which makes it difficult to save the pipeline in a single file as pickling is not possible, unlike for the TF-IDF with linear SVC pipeline.

As for the RoBERTa-based models (baseline and fine-tuned), the model checkpoint files can be found at [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ryE379gpl3f91cRpio6zviJEHCU0RYn3?usp=drive_link). These files can be downloaded and placed in the `models` directory. Doing so will allow the user to load the models and reproduce the results in the notebooks without having to train from scratch.
